    "Renewable Energy (Solar Power Project)": """
A. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project involves installation of a 5 MW grid-connected solar photovoltaic (PV) power plant in Rajasthan, India. The project will generate renewable electricity and supply it to the state grid, replacing fossil-fuel-based generation. This initiative will mitigate approximately 7,200 tCOâ‚‚e annually while supporting Indiaâ€™s clean energy transition. The project contributes to national renewable energy goals and sustainable rural employment.

B. APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY AND SDG CONTRIBUTIONS
Applied Methodology: AMS-I.D â€“ Grid-connected renewable electricity generation.
Relevant SDGs:
â€¢ SDG 7 â€“ Affordable and Clean Energy
â€¢ SDG 8 â€“ Decent Work and Economic Growth
â€¢ SDG 13 â€“ Climate Action

C. DURATION AND CREDITING PERIOD
Start Date: 01 January 2025
Operational Lifetime: 25 years
Crediting Period: 10 years (renewable)

D. SAFEGUARDING PRINCIPLES AND GENDER ASSESSMENT
The project complies with Gold Standard Safeguarding Principles. It involves no involuntary resettlement or biodiversity harm. Women and marginalized groups will be trained for solar maintenance, improving gender equity and technical skill development.

E. STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION
Consultations were conducted in August 2024 with local authorities, NGOs, and community members. The feedback was positive, highlighting employment creation, reduced pollution, and access to clean energy.

Relevant SDGs:
â€¢ SDG 3 â€“ Good Health and Well-being
â€¢ SDG 5 â€“ Gender Equality
â€¢ SDG 13 â€“ Climate Action

C. DURATION AND CREDITING PERIOD
Start Date: 01 April 2024
Operational Lifetime: 10 years
Crediting Period: 7 years

D. SAFEGUARDING PRINCIPLES AND GENDER ASSESSMENT
The project reduces household air pollution, prevents deforestation, and supports womenâ€™s empowerment through improved health, reduced workload, and cost savings.

E. STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION
Consultations were held with village-level communities, NGOs, and womenâ€™s groups. Stakeholders expressed strong support due to health, time-saving, and environmental benefits.

    "Biogas Energy Project": """
A. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project installs 1,000 household-scale biogas units in rural Maharashtra, India. Each digester converts cattle dung into biogas for clean cooking and lighting. The project replaces firewood and LPG consumption, reducing around 8,500 tCOâ‚‚e annually and improving rural sanitation.

B. APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY AND SDG CONTRIBUTIONS
Applied Methodology: AMS-III.R â€“ Methane recovery in agricultural activities.
Relevant SDGs:
â€¢ SDG 7 â€“ Affordable and Clean Energy
â€¢ SDG 3 â€“ Good Health and Well-being
â€¢ SDG 13 â€“ Climate Action

C. DURATION AND CREDITING PERIOD
Start Date: 01 February 2025
Operational Lifetime: 15 years
Crediting Period: 10 years (renewable)

D. SAFEGUARDING PRINCIPLES AND GENDER ASSESSMENT
No adverse environmental or social impacts expected. Women benefit through reduced cooking smoke exposure and opportunities in biogas management and training.

E. STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION
Community consultations were held with rural households, dairy cooperatives, and local NGOs. Feedback highlighted energy cost savings and reduced dependence on firewood.
